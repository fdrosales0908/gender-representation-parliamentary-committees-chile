## Abstract

The Chilean social and feminist movement achieved an important milestone with the introduction of gender parity in the election of representatives to the Constitutional Convention in 2021. However, most academic and public debates have focused on the barriers women face in accessing political office, and less attention has been paid to how power is distributed once women enter decision-making spaces.

This research addresses this gap by analyzing the participation of women in parliamentary committees in the Chilean Chamber of Deputies. Parliamentary committees are understood as strategic spaces for policy formulation and political influence.

Committees were classified as dealing with “feminine” or “masculine” issues, based on existing academic literature. Using a logistic regression model for the period 1990–2021, the study finds that female deputies have only a 31% probability of participating in committees classified as “masculine”.

These results suggest that gender inequality persists not only in access to political representation, but also in the internal distribution of power and policy influence.
